    meaning: Data Lakes are dumping grounds for raw data regardless of format and the data goes into them unprocessed so as to be made available for later use.

There can be many Data Lakes - indeed this is one of the challenges facing big enterprises - the proliferation of Data Lakes and Data Warehouses.

    word: Data Lineage
    meaning: Lineage is a means by which a user can determine the value and trustworthiness of data from the perspective of business impact, compliance, governance, collaboration, and quality. It records the life cycle that data has been through - where it originated from and what has been done to it. For example, raw sales data might come point of sale, which is then processed to extract only certain elements of it, which is combined with customer data from elsewhere to create a dataset. Lineage is tracked at the dataset level, but it can also be the individual data value level. A Data Catalog will record the lineage for a dataset as part of its metadata.

    word: Data Mesh
    meaning: "Data Mesh is seen as a third generation approach to data, beyond Lakes and Warehouses, though it can incorporate both. \n\nThe core principle is that data is organized by domain and treated as a product - the data is kept with those that created it and who have the domain knowledge that describes it. This is in contrast to a Data Lake which aims to put all data in one place owned by a central team.\n\nSo a domain might be an existing data silo, or it might be something new.\n\nTo make the data in these domains discoverable and usable, each domain implements one or more APIs to allow read access to the data.\n\nCritically, though, the data provided by these APIs is ‘well modelled’ - that is, the APIs do not supply raw data, but data that is [perhaps] simplified, pre-aggregated etc. according to the domain knowledge of its owners. The data is prepared for analysis by those that actually understand it.\n\nThis approach means that those wanting to leverage the data don’t need to know the detail at the granular level. So, what might be a fifty table sales database inside the domain, may be served as denormalized (flattened) data for analysis.\n\nAs an architectural approach it can be employed when it comes to leaving data in place - avoiding the movement of data. It would form part of an overall Data Fabric, which would also include, or work with, Data Virtualization."

    word: Data Virtualization
    meaning: "Data Virtualization brings separate datasets - even disparate datasets - together into a unified logical model without physically moving any data around.\n\nData remains in its source system and the Virtualization layer builds a [typically in memory] logical model of it.\n\nThat model can then be queried like a database - the virtualization layer composes and federates the relevant queries to each source system and brings the results back into the in-memory model.\nWhile the actual query retrieves data, it is not moved in the sense that an analytics warehouse requires data to be moved - in that latter case all data is replicated into the warehouse, whereas Virtualization only retrieves the data needed for the analytical task at hand."

    word: Data Warehouse
    meaning: "A Data Warehouse stores well-modelled data, typically in the form of database tables.\n\nWell-modelled means that the data confirms to one or more business perspectives on the data - e.g. all sales by region. The models can range from simple to very complex.\n\nAs such Data Warehouses hold data for the purposes of Business Intelligence analytics, though the actual analysis may be done by separate tools like Tableau or Power BI.\n\nData can be loaded into the Data Warehouse directly from data sources or from data lakes. But because it must be well-modelled, it may require transformation as part of this process - ETL - Extract, Transform, Load.\n\nData Warehouses are typically a first generation approach which take a retrospective view of data and usually only include structured data."

Domains often reflect organisation structures or domains of control within an organisation.

    word: Data Set (dataset)
    meaning: A useful grouping of data within a physical model. For example, Home Insurance Customer Data or Motor Insurance Policy Data. Full physical models can become incredible big, 100’s of tables. Data sets help describe and present specific elements of a physical model in a more readable format. In some systems permissions may be applied around data sets, so that users can only access data that they need. Data Sets may be proximity based, i.e, groups of data that are physically located together OR logical, i.e., groups of data that share similar meaning, purpose or context.
