    word: Data Connector
    meaning: In the context of a Data Catalog, a Connector is a means to extract metadata from a Data Source that describes that data it holds - so that this can then be discovered via the catalog. This would provide an automated means to populate a Data Catalog, though not all datasets can be cataloged in this way - for some it is a manual process.
    contributor_id: Kin+Carta
-
    letter_id: d
    word: Data Dictionary
    meaning: Not to be confused with a Data Catalog - a Data Dictionary is a simple lookup of data objects and schemas. It does not have the search & discovery capabilities of a Data Catalog. Typically a database modelling tool will use a Data Dictionary as a datastore and both would be associated with a specific database platform such as Oracle.

    word: Data Fabric
    meaning: Similar to Data Mesh, this is a less mature architectural approach than Virtualization, so definitions vary. A definition by Talend. In simplest terms, a data fabric is a single environment consisting of a unified architecture, and services or technologies running on that architecture, that helps organizations manage their data. The ultimate goal of data fabric is to maximize the value of your data and accelerate digital transformation.

    word: Data Gravity (yes - it’s a thing)
    meaning: Data begets more data - build a system around data and it generates more data (logs, analytics, reports etc), and attracts more functionality until it is too big to move. It is becoming the force acting against the traditional approach of employing Data Warehouses.
    contributor_id: Kin+Carta
-
    letter_id: d
    word: Data Hierarchy
    meaning: A set of Data Articles organized one above the other in parent-child relationships (one above the other).
    contributor_id: Kin+Carta
-
    letter_id: d
    word: Data Integration
    meaning: This is the bringing together of separate datasets into a single unified view - e.g. merging data from online sales with a product catalog to give a detailed product view of everything sold. In simple database terms this can be a ‘join’ if two tables on some common key like ‘product id’. In more complex scenarios, Data Integration is the merging together of data from separate data sources, even sources of different types such as data from a database and data from a file.

    letter_id: d
    word: Data Key
    meaning: An attribute or a set of attributes that help to uniquely identify a tuple (or row) in a relation (or table). Keys are also used to establish relationships between the different tables and columns of a relational database. Individual values in a key are called key values
    contributor_id: Kin+Carta
-
    letter_id: d
    word: Data Lake
    meaning: Data Lakes are dumping grounds for raw data regardless of format and the data goes into them unprocessed so as to be made available for later use. When used the data may need to be processed to transform it into something useful for, say, analytics. Data Lakes are often simple storage systems. There can be many Data Lakes - indeed this is one of the challenges facing big enterprises - the proliferation of Data Lakes and Data Warehouses.

    letter_id: d
    word: Data Lineage
    meaning: Lineage is a means by which a user can determine the value and trustworthiness of data from the perspective of business impact, compliance, governance, collaboration, and quality. It records the life cycle that data has been through - where it originated from and what has been done to it. For example, raw sales data might come point of sale, which is then processed to extract only certain elements of it, which is combined with customer data from elsewhere to create a dataset. Lineage is tracked at the dataset level, but it can also be the individual data value level. A Data Catalog will record the lineage for a dataset as part of its metadata.

    letter_id: d
    word: Data Locker
    meaning: A separate copy of a system of record which is made to provide access to that data without adding load to the source system. In order to make this data available to the business it would be re-housed in a Data Locker, which itself is then discoverable/curated as part of the Data Catalog.

    letter_id: d
    word: Data Mesh
    meaning: "Data Mesh is seen as a third generation approach to data, beyond Lakes and Warehouses, though it can incorporate both. For more information you can read the relevant section of our Storage to Story Whitepaper.\n\nThe core principle is that data is organized by domain and treated as a product - the data is kept with those that created it and who have the domain knowledge that describes it. This is in contrast to a Data Lake which aims to put all data in one place owned by a central team.\n\nSo a domain might be an existing data silo, or it might be something new.\n\nTo make the data in these domains discoverable and usable, each domain implements one or more APIs to allow read access to the data.\n\nCritically, though, the data provided by these APIs is ‘well modelled’ - that is, the APIs do not supply raw data, but data that is [perhaps] simplified, pre-aggregated etc. according to the domain knowledge of its owners. The data is prepared for analysis by those that actually understand it.\n\nThis approach means that those wanting to leverage the data don’t need to know the detail at the granular level. So, what might be a fifty table sales database inside the domain, may be served as denormalized (flattened) data for analysis.\n\nAs an architectural approach it can be employed when it comes to leaving data in place - avoiding the movement of data. It would form part of an overall Data Fabric, which would also include, or work with, Data Virtualization."

    contributor_id: Kin+Carta
-
    letter_id: d
    word: Data Virtualization
    meaning: "Data Virtualization brings separate datasets - even disparate datasets - together into a unified logical model without physically moving any data around.\n\nData remains in its source system and the Virtualization layer builds a [typically in memory] logical model of it.\n\nThat model can then be queried like a database - the virtualization layer composes and federates the relevant queries to each source system and brings the results back into the in-memory model.\nWhile the actual query retrieves data, it is not moved in the sense that an analytics warehouse requires data to be moved - in that latter case all data is replicated into the warehouse, whereas Virtualization only retrieves the data needed for the analytical task at hand."
    contributor_id: Kin+Carta
-
    letter_id: d
    word: Data Warehouse
    meaning: "A Data Warehouse stores well-modelled data, typically in the form of database tables.\n\nWell-modelled means that the data confirms to one or more business perspectives on the data - e.g. all sales by region. The models can range from simple to very complex.\n\nAs such Data Warehouses hold data for the purposes of Business Intelligence analytics, though the actual analysis may be done by separate tools like Tableau or Power BI.\n\nData can be loaded into the Data Warehouse directly from data sources or from data lakes. But because it must be well-modelled, it may require transformation as part of this process - ETL - Extract, Transform, Load.\n\nData Warehouses are typically a first generation approach which take a retrospective view of data and usually only include structured data."

    word: Dimensional Data
    meaning: Information pertaining to something of interest to a business organized in a hierarchy & attributes.
    contributor_id: Kin+Carta
-
    letter_id: e
    word: ETL - Extract, Transform, Load
    meaning: "To make use of a dataset it might need to be ingested into something like a Data Warehouse or even directly into an analytics tool.\n\nBut the data in its raw form might not be suitable analytics - e.g. it might be too complex or contain quality issues.\n\nETL is basically the process by which data is gotten from the source system, cleaned up, augmented, simplified and then loaded into the analytics platform.\n\nExtract gets the data from the source system, Transform prepares it for analysis, and Load, well, loads it into the analytics platform.\n\nETL can be complex, even labor intensive. Approaches such Virtualization seek to minimize the need for ETL - because they avoid the need to move the data in the first place."

    word: Knowledge Graph
    meaning: "A Knowledge Graph is an extension of a graph structure which surfaces the connections between entities based on their underlying data.\n\nEntities can be anything for which data exists - people, organisations, skills, datasets, objects etc.\n\nIn the context of a Data Catalog, a Knowledge Graph would surface the connections between managed datasets based on the metadata that describes them - i.e. two datasets sharing a common data value (e.g. name of dataset owner) would be seen as connected.\n\nOutside of the Catalog, and as part of data analytics, a Knowledge Graph would be used to surface/discover relationships within/between datasets based on the actual data they contain.\n\nTypically a Knowledge Graph manifests as a visualization, but it can also be consumed as pure data itself.\n\nWe all use Knowledge Graphs every day - Google use them to model meaning and the relationship between entities in the real world."
