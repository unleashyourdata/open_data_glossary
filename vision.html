If every second spent repeating the work and mistakes of others was directed towards innovation then the whole world would be better off for it.
<br><br>
A few people from a few different organisations decided lets start off by sharing our data glossaries. That's every word that is commonly used when implementing 
data initiatives and talking about data.
<br><br>
With time we hope to extend the glossary to cover common words used in different business domains such as retail, transport and agriculture.
<br><br>
We'd love it if you contributed to, so if you spot a missing word, or something you don't agree with then check out the 'Help us' link in the menu and learn how to contribute.

You can download the Yaml data file for this project <a href='https://github.com/unleashyourdata/open_data_glossary/blob/2cff929dbfbcf112a7a3183ca31b7e457e278824/_data/glossary.yml'>here</a> if you want to load the data into your data catelogue's or dictionaries.
