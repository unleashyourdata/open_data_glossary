Trail running is a sport-activity which combines running and sometimes hiking on trails. Trail running normally takes place on good paths, or tracks which are relatively easy to follow, and does not necessarily involve significant amounts of ascent, or need for navigating skills. 

A trail is basically "an unpaved surface" so if you have navigated away from roads and houses you are probably on a trail.

The number of organized trail races grew 1,000% from 2008 to 2018, from 160 to more than 1,800 globally. Runners often cite less impact stress compared to road running, as well as the landscape and non-urban environment, as primary reasons for preferring trail running.
