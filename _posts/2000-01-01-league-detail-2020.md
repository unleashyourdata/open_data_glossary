## What’s this ‘Random 5km Trail League’ thingy about?

Trafford Trails was established to raise the profile of Manchester's beautiful trails, there’s 100’s of them and most of them are completely unknown to the majority of runners.

As we can’t host our 4th Trafford Trails 5 Mile race in June this year we decided to do something a bit different, a league, a socially distanced, trail loving, point scoring league. There will be prizes, kudos, sweat and smiles.

Most importantly we will share your routes and spread the word about where the best trails are.

## Take part from home - virtual trail runs

You can still take part if you are doing all your running on a treadmill at the moment. You may already have found some favourite virtual trail runs or races to watch while doing your treadmill sessions. If not, there are many of these from all over the world freely available, for example, on YouTube. You can choose any that take your fancy for your 5k virtual trail.
