Trafford Trails was established to raise the profile of Manchester's beautiful trails, there’s 100’s of them and most of them are completely unknown to the majority of runners.

As we have had to postpone our 4th Trafford Trails 5 Mile race we decided to do something a bit different, a free to enter, socially distanced, trail loving, point scoring league. There will be prizes, kudos, sweat and smiles.

All you have to do is find a trail, go for a run, send us your result and watch the points add up.
