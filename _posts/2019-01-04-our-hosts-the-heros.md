Without event hosts we wouldn't exist. Our event hosts should really be referred to as Hero's and once you have hosted your first event that is exactly what you will be.&nbsp;

Your job is to find a venue, stir up some interest and be there during the event to make sure it all run's smoothly.

You are an ambassador of our brand and a catalyst for change. It's a job to be proud of.

The Speak Crew will work closely with our hosts to make sure you know what you are doing and to support you throughout the event.

Get involved by emailing [speakfor15@gmail.com](mailto:speakfor15@gmail.com?subject=Please%20can%20I%20host%20a%20speak%20event&amp;body=Yep%2C%20I'm%20a%20wanna%20be%20Hero.%20%0A%0APlease%20let%20me%20throw%20on%20my%20sparking%20cape%2C%20I'd%20love%20to%20host%20an%20event%20sometime%20soon.%0A%0ACheers%2C%0A%0A%3CNAME%20HERE%3E).
