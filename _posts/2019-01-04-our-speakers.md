Getting to speak at one of our events is easy, simply get your name on the schedule by emailing [speakfor15@gmail.com](mailto:speakfor15@gmail.com?subject=Please%20can%20I%20speak%20at%20one%20of%20your%20events&amp;body=Hi%20Speak%20Crew%2C%20%0A%0APretty%20please.%20Please%2C%20please%20and%20please%20again.%0A%0ALet%20me%20speak%20at%20one%20of%20your%20events%3A%0A%0AName%3A%0ATopic%3A%0AMonth%3A%0A%0AThanks%2C). Tell us why you want to speak with us, what you would like to speak about and when you think you will be ready.

Ok, that's the easy bit. Now you need to study and prepare, what we refer to as '***Doing the work*'**.&nbsp;

We will help you by sending you our study notes as soon as we get you on the schedule. In the meantime we have set up a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCsgBcByO61513fsxOT_rrN5AP4tj3rVQ){: target="_blank"} with all of our favourite videos for you to watch. We have also included a couple at the bottom of this page.

Nervous? Doubtful? Anxious? Don't be. Drop us a mail letting us know how you are feeling and we will do our best to help, that's what we are here for.
