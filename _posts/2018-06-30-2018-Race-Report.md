Full race report and results can be found here:[2018 Race Report](http://www.traffordtrails.co.uk/Trafford-Trails-Race-Report-2018.pdf).

This year we saw 194 runners take to the trails of which 137 were first timers and 57 were here for their second outing. Of the 57 2nd timers, 14 achieved a new PB, an amazing achievement given that the heat caused the average time for returning runners to be around 3 minutes slower than their previous attempt. The male / female ratio was exactly 50 / 50 an improvement on the slightly more male dominated race of last year. From an age group perspective, we had a pretty even spread with the Female 40-44 category being by far the most heavily populated.

The winners Harriers dominated again, with Rob Jowett beating last years time of 29:37 by one second and setting a new course record of 29:26. Katherine Wood was new to the race this year and set a new female course record of 32:52. Well done both! We hope you enjoy your prizes, a 1 hour treatment courtesy of Blake's Sports, Nutrition and Massage.
