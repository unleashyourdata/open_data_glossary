subtitle: Why did we create Speak?

We don't think enough ideas are heard and this makes us sad! Sad enough to want to do something about it. We decided to ask people why they don't share their ideas and this is what they said....

* I don't know how to present my idea [Ability]
* I don't know who to tell about my idea [Opportunity]
* I don't think anyone will care about my idea [Belief]

Our aspiration is simply to tackle these problems at what ever scale we can.
