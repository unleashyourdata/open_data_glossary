subtitle: How to become one of our listeners
---

You don't need to be an expert public speaker to be a listener, you don't even need to have stood in front of an audience.

In our listeners we look for two things

* a genuine interest in listening to a broad range of ideas from a diverse group of people and topics
* a desire to help people master the skill of public speaking by providing them with thoughtful and honest feedback

At the event we will give you 5 minutes after each talk to fill in our online feedback form which we will share with you ahead of time so that you can familiarise yourself with it.

Sign up now by emailing [speakfor15@gmail.com](mailto:speakfor15@gmail.com?subject=Please%20can%20I%20listen%20at%20one%20of%20your%20events&amp;body=Hello%20Speak%20Crew%2C%0A%0APlease%20can%20I%20listen%20at%20one%20of%20your%20events.%0A%0AYou%20lot%20are%20awesome%2C%0A%0AMuch%20love.%0A%0A%3Cname%20here%3E).
