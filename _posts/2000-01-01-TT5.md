Unfortunately due to CV-19 it will not be possible to host the event in June as we had planned,
instead we are going to postpone the race in the hope that we will be able to find another date later in the year. 

Due to sunset getting much earlier from early September the latest we could host an evening event would be towards the end of August. 
At the moment we think that is unlikely so we are instead hoping for a winter weekend event. We will keep you posted if anything changes.
For now, entries are closed until we have a new date.
